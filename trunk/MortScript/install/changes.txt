Important changes:

There are some major changes in the MortScript syntax.
While most old scripts should still work, it's recommendet to use the new syntax.

First of all, the (quite few) compatibility breaks:
- The old syntax with "Command=..." (e.g. "Run=\storage\x.exe") is no longer supported!
- If the first parameter is an unquoted Text that starts with an opening paranthesis,
  there'll be errors. E.g. "Message (text?)".
- Variable names are limited to A-Z, a-z, 0-9, and _ (underscore), and mustn't start
  with a digit
- Split with one target variable will use that variable as array name. Better use the
  Part function instead.

What's new?
- %...% around variables are no longer required in expressions and x=... assignment.
  They're only required if a variable contents is to be used in the old command syntax
  without quotes (see below).
- Arrays are possible by using [index] after the variable name, e.g. myArray[5].
  Alphanumeric indexes (myMap["x"]) are possible, too. The index is not case sensitive.
  Some commands like Split or Choice support array parameters. They use the indexes
  for 1 to the least not found index (i.e., if the elements 1,2,5,and "x" are set, only
  1 and 2 are used).
- Parameters should be set in parantheses. If so, all parameters are handled as
  expression, i.e., you have to use quotes for fixed strings.
  Example: Message( "Text: " & text, "Title" )
- There are functions for all commands that set one variable and all conditions.
  Functions are called similar to the commands, but must be used in an expression
  (i.e. as parameter or with variable = expression) and the parameters must be
  enclosed in parantheses (no old syntax).
  Examples:
  x = Part( "a|b|c", "|", 2 )
  If ( wndExists( "Word" ) and not wndActive( "Desktop" ) )
- lots of other new functions - see commands.txt
