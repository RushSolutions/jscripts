The program is freeware.

I.e., it can be copied freely, as long as there aren't any modifications.
This relates also to all texts and the setup program.
If you want to fix bad translations/spellings, please write me.
Publishing on CDs, DVDs, own homepages, and so on is expressly allowed.

I don't offer any warranty for any damages caused by the program!
There shoudn't happen anything in theory, but backups never harm...
